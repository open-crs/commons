# `commons` ðŸ“¦

## Description

`commons` is a Python 3 library containing useful implementations for all CRS modules:

- utility functions and classes
- interfaces
- enumerations

The enumerations are not exhaustive.
They define the minimal set of members that are used in OpenCRS.
For example, `InputStreams` doesn't define an `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE` (a valid input stream for an executable) as this case is not tacked yet by the project.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have set up the repositories and Python environment according to the [top-level instructions](https://github.com/open-crs#requirements).
   That is:

   - Docker is installed and is properly running.
     Check using:

     ```console
     docker version
     docker ps -a
     docker run --rm hello-world
     ```

     These commands should run without errors.

   - The current repository and the [`commons` repository](https://github.com/open-crs/commons) are cloned (with submodules) in the same directory.

   - You are running all commands inside a Python virtual environment.
     There should be `(.venv)` prefix to your prompt.

   - You have installed Poetry in the virtual environment.
     If you run:

     ```console
     which poetry
     ```

     you should get a path ending with `.venv/bin/poetry`.

1. Disable the Python Keyring:

   ```console
   export PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND=keyring.backends.null.Keyring
   ```

   This is a problem that may occur in certain situations, preventing Poetry from getting packages.

1. Install the required packages with Poetry (based on `pyprojects.toml`):

   ```console
   poetry install --only main
   ```

1. Build the [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) and [QBDI](https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI) Docker images used by other modules:

   ```console
   docker build --tag ghidra -f commons/ghidra/docker/Dockerfile commons/ghidra/docker
   docker build --platform linux/386 --tag qbdi_args_fuzzing -f commons/qbdi/docker/Dockerfile commons/qbdi/docker
   ```
